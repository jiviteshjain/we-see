# We See

*A Word Search Puzzle Solver*

This is a Word Search Puzzle Solver, which uses computer vision and machine learning to read a word search puzzle and finds the requested word in it using a simple brute-force search.

Details on how it works can be found in the Jupyter Notebook itself, alongside the code.

## Get it running

You'll need OpenCV for Python3, NumPy, matplotlib, pandas and Jupyter Notebook/Lab installed on your system. We recommend an Anaconda installation with OpenCV 4.2.0.

Once you have that set up, simply start the Jupyter Notebook server:
```(shell)
$ jupyter notebook
```
and you should be rolling at `localhost:8888/notebooks/We-See.ipynb`.
